                            <p>
                                On the 11st January, I participated my first hackathon. It was SUPER FUN!!!! I got to work on an app with my friends. Our project
                                is called GreenLab, which focus to promote a greener life style. It provides locatin information for different second hands shops, different
                                dates of events, and a recycler bot, which distinguish what item could be recycled. Apart from that, there is an authentification system, which each
                                user has a qr code and a balance, so that whenever they recycled an item, their balance will be incremented. I really enjoyed the hackathon a lot, eventhough
                                I only got 2 hours of sleep. I am very proud of my team, and our project. It was definitely the best hackathon one can ever have.

                                I have taken the Introductory and Intermediate level Machine Learning course in Kaggle during the winter break. In the course, I have learnt to treat data
                                using the pandas and the numpy library and handle categorical data using the One hot encoder from the sklearn library. Apart from that, I also tried different models
                                such as the line regression model, DecisionTreeRegressor, and the RandomForestRegressor. Lastly, I tested the performance of the model using mean absolute error and 
                                cross validation (using different folds).

                            <p>
                                I built a recpetion app for a dispalying robot, in Java aand with Android Studio and the robot SDK. The aim was to develop an app so that it can move
                                the robot, and  do whatever a receptionalist can do. This includes, leading the visitors to different places of the office, signing in and out for visitors
                                and informing vistors about upcoming events. Apart from this, we've also implemented tts and voice command abilities to the app, making it more interactive.
                                Apart from that, I also built a backend website using php, sql, html and css for the museum app. The goal of the museum app is to allowing a robot to do whatever
                                or even better than what a museum guide can do. It should be able to explain and provide media contents when it arrived at certain marker. The website that I worked
                                on allows users to upload explanations and customized medias contents for different markers. Lastly, I was also part of the team that designs
                                the course materials for their stem program. The plan is to teach children code in java, so that they can eventually create programs for our robots.
                                It was a very fruitful and fun experience overall.

                            This conference was organized by the Undergraduate Artificial Intelligence Group in the University of Toronto.
                            I listened to insightful talks delivered by experts of the field. I have learnt
                            more about knowledge distillation, Adversarial examples, Capsulated neural network,
                            undergraduate research opportunities(For ai), and careers possibilities of AI.

                        <p>
                            On the first day, I learnt about what a convolutional Neural Network and what machine
                            learning is. After that, I learnt to how to write a ML model to predict the best fit line of a given set
                            of data. I also  built an Image Classifier in Pycharm with Tensorflow in Ubuntu, and trained it with the
                            MNIST dataset, which is a dataset that contains a bunch of handwritten numbers. After having a hand-on
                            experience on building a simple neural network myself, I have this opportunity to play with the neural networkr
                            developed by Google, the tensorflow for poets2. I trained it with 100 images of ordinary apples, and test it
                            eventually. Interestingly, I found that the neural network is able to recognize different images of apple, even sketches and abstract paintings of apple!!
                            However, it fails to identify an image of an apple, with inverted colors.(when the apple is blue).

                            I have leant about the basics of C++. From the course, I have developed simple programs
                            like a calculator, a word counter and a simple game on Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Boys. It was a fun experience
                            and I'll definitely recommend the course to others, especially for beginners like me.
