                    <p>
                        In this course, I have learnt about major mathematical concepts in Computer Science. I got a chance to explore
                        Proof By Induction, Big O notation, graphs and Trees and more. Even though the course was challenging, I am glad that
                        I took it, as it is amazing to see how much I was capable to achieved in this short period of time.
                        My final grade for this course is A.

                    <p>
                        After completing the introductory course for Python, I learnt about recursion, trees and linked list in this course.
                        The assignments in this course were pretty fun. I got to work with a partner. We were given two interesting tasks. The first assignment
                        was interesting in terms of its complicated structure. Our goal is to analyze the minutes of phone calls for thousands of virtual users, 
                        and get their bill according to their various phone plans. We had a chance to practise our knowledge in abstract classes and inheritance. Our 
                        second task, we created a tree map for files and subfolders in a given folder. It is fun to see how rectangles of different sizes and colors 
                        represents various files. 
                        My final grade for this course is A.

                    <p>Instructed by Professor Jiaqi Liu</p>
                    <p>
                        Linear Algebra was new for me, because I haven't explore concepts like span and matrixes in a detailed manner during high school. I imagined
                        it to be really hard, but it turns out to be easier than I thought. Although I was kind of stuck when I encountered dimensions and eigenvectors, I
                        managed to learn more in the study sessions before the midterms and exams. It really helped me to consolidate the knowledge, and to make sense of different
                        modules when they all intercept with each other.
                        My final grade for this course is A+.

                        <p>To be frank, I took this course originally to satisfy my br requirements, and therefore I credit-no-credit it in the beginning. However, this course
                        is more fascinating than I thought it would be.I did not only explored further in Beethoven's music, including his symphonies, his sonatas, but also get a chance
                        to know more about his personal life and the political environment he was in. Towards the end of the course, my group did a group project on the Immortal Beloved, which is
                        a series of love letters written by Beethoven to an unknown woman.
                        I passed the course (no grade as I credit no credit it).

                        In this course, I have learnt how to program in Python. During the course, I have completed three assignments.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Assignment on word finder game (reversing a string, accumulating scores, comparison)</li>
                            <li>Assignment on analyzing bridge data (arrange it to a clean format, get average, find closer bridge, etc)</li>
                            <li>Assignment on analyzing tweet data, (opening file, reading file, writing file and categorizing them)</li>

                        At the end of the course, we have to do a project about online communities. Below is some more information about my project:

                            Although this course was pretty challenging, I end up enjoying this course a lot. The satisfaction that I have gained after
                            solving a math problem make me feel like I am the KING of the world!!!!

                            In this course, I have learnt more about the Olympian gods and goddesses, greek heroes and the history of Rome. The most
                            interesting thing about the course is the emphasis on mortal suffering, usually from the gods, from different primary context, and people's views
                            towards mythologies.

                            We have to do two group projects, which is required to give an oral presentation and a submit a written report of our research findings.
                            In our first project, our group focus on how there can be social causation of diseases, while we work on the importance on social attachments
                            in our second project.
